# Optimization of Memory Footprint for Junos XML Struct

## Introduction

In optimizing software, especially when working with large data structures or frequently used ones, managing memory efficiently can lead to better performance and reduced resource usage. Here, we present an optimization we performed on the Junos XML struct for the Route-Table. When parsing data into go from a JunOs device we need a struct. How we define that struct has an impact on the overall memory usage. This of course may not be an issue but we want to ensure that the memory used is optimal and is as small a footprint as possible.
The `main.go` will load 2x structs the orginal one `RpcReply` and `RpcReplyOptimized` and you will be presented with total allocations.

## Initial Structure: `RpcReply`

Initially, the `RpcReply` struct for the Junos XML was defined as:

```go
type RpcReply struct {
    XMLName xml.Name `xml:"rpc-reply"`
    // ... other fields ...

    Cli struct {
        Text   string `xml:",chardata"`
        Banner string `xml:"banner"`
    } `xml:"cli"`
}
```

The primary concern here was the memory usage of individual fields, especially when the overall structure would be instantiated multiple times.

## Optimizations Performed

### 1. Converting `CLI` field to a Pointer

Instead of having the `Cli` field embedded directly within our struct, we converted it into a pointer. This drastically reduced the memory footprint because we only needed to allocate memory for the pointer, rather than the entire struct every time.

The optimized `RpcReplyOptimized` struct looked like this:

```go
type RpcReplyOptimized struct {
    XMLName xml.Name `xml:"rpc-reply"`
    // ... other fields ...

    Cli *Cli `xml:"cli"`
}
```

This ensures that the `Cli` struct is only allocated once and then shared among all instances of `RpcReplyOptimized`, saving significant memory.

### 2. Grouping Strings and Ints Together

In Go, due to memory alignment considerations, the order in which you declare fields in a struct can influence its memory usage. By grouping fields of similar types together, we can ensure Go doesn't overallocate memory due to padding.

For instance, rather than having:

```go
struct {
    a string
    b int
    c string
}
```

We reordered the fields like this:

```go
struct {
    a string
    c string
    b int
}
```

This takes advantage of the memory alignment of similar types and ensures no extra memory is wasted.
Notice how we go from 152 bytes down to 128 bytes by doing this optimization
```
================================================================================
Total Memory Usage StructType: RpcReply main.RpcReply => [152]
================================================================================
Total Memory Usage StructType: RpcReplyOptimized main.RpcReplyOptimized => [128]
================================================================================
```
## Conclusion

By adopting a strategic approach to struct layout and being conscious of Go's memory alignment behavior, we achieved a more memory-efficient representation of our Junos XML struct. As applications scale and data grows, such optimizations can lead to significant savings in resources and improved performance.
